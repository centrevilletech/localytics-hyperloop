### Roadmap

The initial version of this project provides enough to use the basics of Localytics on iOS and Android,
and also the app inbox on iOS. AppInbox support for Android is planned in the future.

### Preparing your environment.

First, make sure you have Titanium SDK "7.1.0.v20180207124118" installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, you
can install it by running `ti sdk install 7.1.0.v20180207124118`.
